Original (@angular/material@14.2.7) released at Sept/09/23.

## Used and checked

Tested in ng `14.2.7`, `15.2.4` and `16.2.5` without problems.

## Warnings

Need to be used more in `^17.0.0` but it work in `17.0.0-next.7` so I wanna believe it still be compatible.

Same for `rxjs@^8.0.0`, maybe work, maybe not, but it's not worth publishing just to add one more approved version.
